# Grocery Item Counter using Computer Vision

This repository contains a working prototype for an application that counts items in a grocery shop or inventory warehouse using a camera. The system leverages deep learning (using a pre-trained YOLOv5 model) to detect objects, counts them, and associates each detection with product details from a simulated product database.

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for counting items using a camera. The application:
- Captures images via a webcam.
- Processes images with a YOLOv5 model (loaded via PyTorch Hub) to detect and count objects.
- Looks up associated product details (brand and product name) using a simulated product database.
- Displays the detection results with bounding boxes and labels.

The system is designed to function even if detailed product information is not availableâ€”by simply aggregating the count of similar items.

## Features

- **Real-time Image Capture:** Uses OpenCV to capture images from a webcam.
- **Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv5 to identify items in the captured image.
- **Product Counting:** Counts detected items and aggregates results.
- **Product Lookup:** Matches detected labels with a product details dictionary.
- **Visualization:** Annotates and displays images with bounding boxes and labels.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main script to capture an image, perform object detection, count items, and display annotated results.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: (Optional) File listing project dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- A functional webcam connected to your system

### Python Dependencies
